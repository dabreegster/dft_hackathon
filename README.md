# DfT connectivity hackathon

## Development

Vanilla JS right now, no tooling. You need Python to run an example web server. Just run:

```bash
./serve_locally.sh
```

and then go to <http://0.0.0.0:8000/>. You can just refresh the page and leave this server running.

You might need a Firefox "CORS Everywhere" extension or similar to develop locally. Use that at your own risk and/or please file an issue and tell me how to do this properly.
