pop_weighted_score is calculated weighting each ‘overall_diff’ in output table by the respective LSOA populations compared to the EW average LSOA population. So increasing overall connectivity in a high population LSOA will have more of an impact on the pop_weighted_score



>>Dustin msg:

-what added
can add multiple routes and new builds, or combination of the two - as many as you like

file uploader: for users to upload csv of multiple routes (doesnt allow new builds)

some visual things: data displayed on mouseover, legend for choropleth. Not wonderfully formatted yet but want them in place see people can see more info quicker




-features which I think would get it to an MVP:
doesnt use frequency or speed data yet, though it does store them in 'feature'. Could add in other variables like start times of day, then store them in features_all and use them in callAPI

get new build centroids: atm I don't extract these from the polygon, nor do I extract the area from the polygon

draw polygons on map: still struggling with this over the existing polygons layer, even if I untoggle it

process api outputs: I haven't done anything with this yet

<<Very open to ways to structure it all better! Interested/excited for svelte possibility, though with a few whispers of concern about maintainability going forward 



Other stuff - I havent figured out CORS when locally hosting



Both - I'm about to go on leave until the 9th of Jan, so will wish you both a very merry Christmas! Looking forward to cracking on with this in the new year



>>Rob and eloise email to LAs (fwd to robin and dustin so they can see it too)
